# FMCW-Radar-Based-Berthing-System
This repository contains the Python code developed for the Radar-Based Berthing Aid System project. The project took place in University of West Attica, Greece, under the Master by Research. It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, training, and evaluation scripts for machine learning and deep learning models used to classify radar point clouds into Dock and No Dock categories.
The radars that were used were the AWR1443BOOST, AWR1642BOOST, AWR1843BOOST and IWR6843ISK from Texas Instruments. The implementation included a Raspberry Pi 4 and a supportive subsystem for measurements at the field, a Ro/Ro Pax ferry which was operating normaly.
